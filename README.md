# Indian Bird Species Prediction Model

A deep learning model for predicting Indian bird species, implemented in Python using TensorFlow-GPU, with visualization using Matplotlib. The model classifies images into 25 different bird species native to India.


## Introduction

This project focuses on classifying images of Indian bird species using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow-GPU. The model is capable of predicting one of the 25 bird species included in the dataset.

## Dataset

Describe the dataset used for training and testing the model. Include information about the number of classes, the number of images per class, and any preprocessing steps applied to the data.

## Features

- TensorFlow-GPU for efficient deep learning model training.
